# Mithril Components

This is a set of reusable components for the [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org/) JavaScript front-end library.

Each component has only enough CSS styling to reset their appearance to a sane default across different browsers.

The set of components are pulled from:
- [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/docs/components/)
- [Google Material Design](https://material.io/)



## Getting Started

1. Ensure `node` and `npm` are installed and are in your OS path
2. Run: `npm start`
